Hello friends, welcome!
This code simulates the game of Blackjack and also predicts the probability of winning and losing based on the player's decisions using Monte Carlo simulation.

Here are some of the key features of the code:

Simulates the game of Blackjack: The code simulates the game of Blackjack for a single player against the dealer.

Predicts the probability of winning and losing: The code uses Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability of winning and losing for each possible decision that the player can make. This is done by simulating the game many times and averaging the results.


Provides feedback: The code provides feedback to the player after each simulation. This feedback includes the player's win rate, the dealer's win rate, and the average number of hands played.
Here are some of the limitations of the code:

Does not support multiple players: The code currently only supports single-player Blackjack. Support for multiple players will be added in a future update.
Does not account for dealer's hole card: The code does not account for the dealer's hole card when making predictions. This means that the predictions may not be accurate.
